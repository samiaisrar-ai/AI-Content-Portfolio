## 🧠 Definition: Image Generation with AI

Image generation with AI is the process of creating pictures, illustrations, or realistic visuals automatically using artificial intelligence models. These models—such as DALL·E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion—are trained on massive datasets of images and can produce entirely new visuals from simple text prompts.

AI image generation works by interpreting your written description (for example, “a pastel pink mug on a wooden desk under soft sunlight”) and rendering a unique image that matches it. It’s widely used for content creation, marketing, design, and concept visualization.
